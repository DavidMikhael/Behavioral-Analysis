The "CalibrationImages" folder contains the checkerboard images I took for calibration of the 3 cameras
The Primary and Secondary folders in the "CalibrationImages" contain the calibration images that MATLAB uses to calibrate recordings -
from the 3 cameras (Primary, Secondary1, and Secondary2)
The CalibSessionFiles folder contain the calibration output .mat file that MATLAB uses to produce the 3D reconstruction video
The "Experiment_3Ddata" folder has the Data3D.mat file which includes the 3D reconstruction data, and the -
experiment 3D movie which has an interactive 3D tracking of mouse's movement throughout the experiment
The CSVFiles are the DeepLabCut-produced tracking data
The "Exp_config" folder contains the configuration file which I edited according to the specifics of my experiment and file paths
